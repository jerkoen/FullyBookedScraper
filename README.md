Small project I did for learning how to webscrape using python + mongodb. <br />
Mainly followed John Watson Rooney's tutorial on YouTube. Title: Try this Web Scraping Project with Mongodb (Code Along). <br />

## Website Used
- [Fully Booked](https://fullybookedonline.com)  
- Specific page: [Fave Reads under PHP 800](https://fullybookedonline.com/collections/featured-collections/fave-reads-under-php800.html)

## What the Program Does
- Sends requests to Fully Booked's GraphQL API  
- Extracts book details (title, author, price, description)  
- Handles pagination to collect all items  
- Saves the results in a MongoDB database
